Objectives:

*Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables.

*Split the data into training and testing sets.

*Train the model on the training data.

*Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

*Make predictions on the test set.

*Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

Key Activities:

1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and perform any necessary data cleaning.

3.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4.Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

6.Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.

7.Visualization:

*Plot the regression line.

*Visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Technologies Used:

-Python: The programming language used for the analysis and modeling.

-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

-numpy: For numerical operations.

-scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

-matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

-seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Key Insights:

-Model Performance: The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R², which indicate how well the model fits the data.

-Regression Line: The regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between the feature and the target variable.

-Actual vs. Predicted Values: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps in assessing the model's accuracy and identifying any systematic errors
